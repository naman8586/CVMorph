## 1. Executive Summary

Hiring today is driven by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and role-specific keyword matching. Highly capable candidates are often rejected not because they lack skills, but because their resumes are not *positioned* correctly for the specific role they are applying to.

This project aims to build an **AI-powered resume automation platform** that transforms a user’s *single source of truth* (their real experience, skills, and projects) into **multiple job-specific, ATS-approved resumes** — without the user manually rewriting their resume again and again.

The platform will help candidates efficiently apply to frontend, backend, Python, data, or other technical roles by automatically adapting resume content to each role while maintaining factual accuracy and a fixed, ATS-safe template.

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 The Current Hiring Problem

* ATS systems filter resumes before humans see them
* ATS systems prioritize:

  * Role-specific keywords
  * Section ordering
  * Relevant experience emphasis
* Candidates often have **multi-domain skills** (e.g., full-stack developers)
* One static resume cannot optimally match all roles

### 2.2 User Pain Points

* Rewriting resumes for every job is time-consuming
* Candidates unintentionally down-rank themselves
* ATS rejects resumes despite strong qualifications
* Resume formatting mistakes lead to auto-rejection

### 2.3 Why Existing Tools Fail

* Generic resume generators hallucinate experience
* AI tools rewrite resumes without ATS awareness
* No control over layout consistency
* No versioning or structured data model

## 3. Vision & Product Philosophy

### Vision

> To make job applications role-adaptive, automated, and fair — by letting candidates showcase the *same real experience* through the *right lens* for each job.

### Core Principles

* **One Source of Truth** – store facts, not resumes
* **No Hallucination** – AI never invents skills or experience
* **Fixed ATS Template** – layout never changes
* **Role-Based Emphasis** – content adapts, facts do not
* **Transparency** – user sees exactly what changed

## 4. What We Are Building

### High-Level Description

A web-based application where users:

1. Enter their experience, education, projects, and skills once
2. Select a job role and optionally paste a job description
3. Instantly receive a role-optimized resume using the same ATS-approved template
4. Export the resume as PDF
5. Maintain multiple resume versions for different roles

---

## 5. Core Features

### 5.1 Structured Resume Input

* Personal details
* Education
* Work experience (fact-based bullets)
* Projects
* Skills and tools

All data is stored in structured form (not paragraphs).

---

### 5.2 Role Selection Engine

Supported roles (initial MVP):

* Frontend Developer
* Backend Developer
* Python Developer

Future roles:

* Data Analyst
* DevOps
* Full Stack

---

### 5.3 AI Resume Adaptation Engine

The AI layer performs:

* Bullet point rewriting
* Section reordering
* Keyword emphasis
* Relevance scoring

The AI explicitly does **NOT**:

* Add new skills
* Add fake metrics
* Change job titles
* Modify layout

---

### 5.4 ATS-Approved Resume Template

* Single-column layout
* No icons or graphics
* No tables
* Consistent typography
* Optimized for ATS parsing

The same template is used for all resumes.

---

### 5.5 Resume Versioning

* Each role generates a new resume version
* Users can compare versions
* History is preserved

---

## 6. Use of Artificial Intelligence

### Why AI is Needed

* Manual resume tailoring does not scale
* Job descriptions vary widely
* Keyword matching must be contextual, not mechanical

### AI Responsibilities

* Semantic rewriting of bullets
* Mapping user experience to job requirements
* Removing irrelevant emphasis

### AI Guardrails

* Prompt-level constraints
* Fact-only transformations
* Role-specific templates

## 7. System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

Frontend (Next.js)

* Resume builder UI
* Role selection
* Live preview
* Authentication

Backend (Node.js + Express)

* Resume processing APIs
* AI orchestration
* Export services

Database (PostgreSQL)

* User profiles
* Resume base data
* Resume versions

AI Layer

* Gemini API (pluggable)

---

## 8. Tech Stack

### Frontend

* Next.js (App Router)
* React
* Tailwind CSS

### Backend

* Node.js
* Express.js

### Database

* PostgreSQL
* Prisma ORM

### AI Integration

* Gemini API (initial)
* Pluggable provider design

### Resume Rendering

* HTML + CSS
* PDF generation

---

## 9. Data Model (Conceptual)

* User
* ResumeBase (facts)
* ResumeVersion (role-based output)
* JobRole

This separation ensures accuracy, traceability, and scalability.

## 10. Security & Ethics

* No resume data shared with third parties
* AI outputs are deterministic and auditable
* User controls all exports
* No scraping of job portals in MVP

---

## 11. MVP Scope

### Phase 1 (MVP)

* User authentication
* Resume fact input
* One ATS template
* 3 job roles
* AI-powered rewriting
* PDF export

### Phase 2

* Job description parsing
* Resume scoring
* Skill gap suggestions

### Phase 3

* Job portal autofill
* Resume analytics
* Premium templates

---

## 12. Success Metrics

* Resume creation time reduced by >80%
* Multiple resumes generated from one profile
* Improved ATS keyword matching
* Positive user feedback

---

## 13. Long-Term Vision

* Become a personal career automation engine
* Resume + cover letter + application autofill
* Career path recommendations
* Interview preparation insights

## 14. Conclusion

This project solves a **real hiring inefficiency** using a clean mix of structured data, AI transformation, and ATS-aware design. It is technically feasible, ethically sound, and highly scalable.

The platform empowers candidates to compete fairly by presenting their real skills in the most relevant way — automatically.
